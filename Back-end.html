        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Back-end development refers to the server-side part of web development, focusing on the functionality, database interactions, and server management that happen behind the scenes. It ensures that everything on the front-end works seamlessly, handling tasks such as processing user requests, managing data, and ensuring the security and performance of applications. Back-end developers use programming languages like Python, Java, and PHP, along with frameworks and databases, to build the infrastructure that supports dynamic websites and applications. Without a solid back-end, web applications wouldn’t be able to process data, authenticate users, or perform any of the critical operations that users interact with.</p>
