        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Front-End Development is the process of building the visual components of websites and web applications that users interact with directly. Using core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, front-end developers focus on creating an engaging and responsive experience. This includes designing clean layouts, ensuring smooth navigation, and making sure that websites are accessible across all devices and browsers.

            I have worked on several front-end projects, such as:
            
            Portfolio Website: Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to showcase my work and skills. Focused on responsive design to ensure it works well on both desktop and mobile.
            E-Commerce Site: Created an interactive online store with React and Redux for dynamic product pages and a smooth shopping experience.
            Landing Page for a Startup: Designed a modern, user-friendly landing page using Bootstrap and CSS Grid, ensuring it was SEO-friendly and optimized for fast load times.</p>
